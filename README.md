nPM2100 bare metal drivers
==========================

This folder will eventually be moved to a separate public repo

Introduction
------------

This driver collection supports bare metal development with the nPM2100.
For development using NCS or Zephyr, use the native drivers instead.

To adapt this to your own project, copy the src and hal folders to your project.
The hal drivers need to be adapted to support your hardware platform.
